# Laravel OTP â–²

## Introduction ðŸ––

This is a simple package to generate and validate OTPs (One Time Passwords). This can be implemented mostly in Authentication.

## Installation ðŸ’½

Install via composer

```bash
composer require turahe/otp
```

Add service provider to the `config/app.php` file

```php
<?php
   /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Autoloaded Service Providers
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The service providers listed here will be automatically loaded on the
    | request to your application. Feel free to add your own services to
    | this array to grant expanded functionality to your applications.
    |
    */

    'providers' => [
        ...
        Turahe\Otp\OtpServiceProvider::class,
    ];
...
```

Add alias to the `config/app.php` file

```php
<?php

   /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Class Aliases
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This array of class aliases will be registered when this application
    | is started. However, feel free to register as many as you wish as
    | the aliases are "lazy" loaded so they don't hinder performance.
    |
    */

    'aliases' => [
        ...
        'Otp' => Turahe\Otp\Otp::class,
    ];
...
```

## Usage ðŸ§¨

>**NOTE**</br>

### Generate OTP

```php
<?php

Otp::generate(string $identifier int $validity = 10)
```

* `$identifier`: The identity that will be tied to the OTP.
* `$validity (optional | default = 10)`: The validity period of the OTP in minutes.

#### Sample

```php
<?php
use Turahe\otp\Facades\Otp;
$otp = Otp::generate('nur@wach.id', 15);
```

This will generate a six digit OTP that will be valid for 15 minutes and the success response will be:

```object
{
  "id": 1,
  "identity": "nur@wach.id",
  "token": "282581",
  "created_at": "2020-01-01 00:00:00",
  "updated_at": "2020-01-01 00:00:00"
}
```

### Validate OTP

```php
<?php

Otp::validate(string $identifier, string $token)
```

* `$identifier`: The identity that is tied to the OTP.
* `$token`: The token tied to the identity.

#### Sample

```php
<?php

$otp = Otp::validate('nur@wach.id', '282581');
```


### Delete expired tokens
You can delete expired tokens by running the following artisan command:
```bash
php artisan otp:clean
```
You can also add this artisan command to `app/Console/Kernel.php` to automatically clean on scheduled
```php
<?php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('otp:clean')->daily();
}
```
